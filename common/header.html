<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In his recent documentary series called Stakeholder Capitalism, filmmaker and tech entrepreneur, Richard Jeffs, investigates our current undemocratic ten-year transition to an authoritarian political system called Stakeholder Capitalism. View our films and articles to learn what Stakeholder Capitalism is and how, since 2020 (when it was enacted), it’s been driving the rise in strange societal and global events.</p>

<p>To summarise, Stakeholder Capitalism is the brainchild of Klaus Schwab, the Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF). The WEF’s exclusive members, called Stakeholders, include the heads of all G20 countries, multinational NGOs and most fortune 500 companies. Enacted through a ten-year initiative called The Great Reset, the Stakeholders are driving our transition to a single, global, authoritarian political system called Stakeholder Capitalism.</p>

<p>The Great Reset ten-year transition to Stakeholder Capitalism exploits a pivotal time in our near future: A.I. taking our jobs. Referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, this period will precipitate humanities’ largest shift in wealth, significantly disrupting our economic system and inflicting third-world levels of poverty on as many as 50% of people through-out the West.</p>

<p>Yellow.Forum is a solution-focussed organisation that investigates and addresses imminent threats to our freedom and prosperity. Instead of this decade being known as The Great Reset, our mission is to shape The Great Revolution, a period when people unite and build a brighter future.</p>

<h3>Our strategy is to: </h3>

<p><b>-	Investigate threats</b> by empowering independent journalists to crowd-fund projects</p>
<p><b>-	Create awareness</b> by producing news, films and viral content</p>
<p><b>-	Design solutions</b> by hosting interactive debate show</p>
<p><b>-	Drive change</b> by providing a platform for managing initiatives</p>

<p>We are a grassroots organisation that requires your collaboration and support to achieve our mission</p>
